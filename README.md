# Rock Paper Scissors - With Score

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game which keeps score! Borrowed the looping functionaity from my previous script and modified it a little to suit this game.

# What I Learned

* experimented using the while, if, elif & else functions.
* Working with global and local variables.
* Used a forloop to create a short animation which can be easily modified and reused.
* Creating helper functions and calling them in later
* Some exposure to the random library
